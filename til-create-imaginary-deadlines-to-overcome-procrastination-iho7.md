# Create imaginary deadlines to overcome procrastination

> Sunday, February 13, 2022


While I was reading Eat that Frog by Brian Tracy, one of the hacks he mentioned in order to overcome
procrastination is to create imaginary deadlines!

Imagine each day that you have just received an emergency text message and that you would need to
leave work.

What job or task is it that you would make sure that it is absolutely done or complete before you
left for the emergency?

What ever the answer is, go work on that task right now!
